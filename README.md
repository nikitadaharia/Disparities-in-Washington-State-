# Disparities-in-Washington-State-

The purpose of this project was to analyze the disparities amongst various groups of individuals in the Washington state using Tableau. The data for this study was harvested from an interactive tool via the University of Washington Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Services (DEOHS) in collaboration with the Washington State Department of Health (DOH). For this analysis, four variables were pulled from the tool: 
1.	People of Color (Race/ Ethnicity)
2.	No high school diploma 
3.	Single parent households 
4.	Population living in poverty <=185% of Federal poverty level
This data was be evaluated to determine if there are any correlations between individuals belonging from a specific race/ethnicity, with lower education level and, with single parent households especially as it relates to impoverished populations from a broad perspective who are at higher risk to face poverty. The results from this analyses can be used to explore various avenues to improve policies and equity for these disadvantaged communities. This project was completed as one of my final projects for the Quantitative Methods course at the University of Washington.
